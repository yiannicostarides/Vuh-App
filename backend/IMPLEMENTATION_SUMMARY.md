### ✅ Sub-task 4: Implement User model with preferences and location handling

**Location**: `backend/src/repositories/UserRepository.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Complete user management with device-based identification
- User preferences management (radius, preferred stores, categories)
- Notification settings management
- Location tracking with timestamps
- User statistics and analytics
- Preference-based user queries

**Key Features**:
- Device ID-based user identification
- Granular notification preferences
- Location privacy and validation
- User segmentation by preferences
- Last login tracking

### ✅ Sub-task 5: Write unit tests for all database operations

**Location**: `backend/src/tests/repositories/`

**Test Files**:
- `DealRepository.test.ts` - 15+ test cases covering all deal operations
- `StoreRepository.test.ts` - 12+ test cases covering all store operations  
- `UserRepository.test.ts` - 18+ test cases covering all user operations
- `ShoppingListRepository.test.ts` - 12+ test cases covering shopping list operations

**Test Coverage**:
- CRUD operations for all models
- Validation error handling
- Location-based queries
- Filtering and pagination
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Data integrity and relationships

### Additional Implementation Details

#### Database Schema
**Location**: `backend/database/schema.sql`
- Complete PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Custom functions (distance calculation, updated_at triggers)
- Proper data types and constraints

#### Type Definitions
**Location**: `backend/src/types/models.ts`
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Database record interfaces with proper field mappings
- API request/response models
- Validation schemas
- Enum definitions

#### Base Repository Pattern
**Location**: `backend/src/repositories/BaseRepository.ts`
- Abstract base class with common database operations
- Transaction support
- Query building utilities
- Error handling and logging
- Pagination helpers

## Requirements Mapping

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the specification:

### Requirement 2.3: Deal Data Storage and Management
- ✅ Deal data stored with timestamps and expiration dates
- ✅ Geographic filtering for location-based queries
- ✅ REST endpoint support for deal queries

### Requirement 6.2: Data Encryption and Security
- ✅ Prepared statements prevent SQL injection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Secure database connection configuration

### Requirement 6.3: Privacy and Data Handling
- ✅ User location data properly managed
- ✅ Soft delete functionality for data retention policies
- ✅ User preference management with privacy controls

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests that cover:

1. **Positive Test Cases**: Normal operation scenarios
2. **Negative Test Cases**: Error handling and validation
3. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
4. **Integration Scenarios**: Cross-repository operations
5. **Performance Cases**: Location queries and filtering

## Database Performance Optimizations

1. **Indexes**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
3. **Query Optimization**: Efficient JOIN operations and filtering
4. **Geographic Queries**: Optimized distance calculations
5. **Pagination**: Memory-efficient large dataset handling

## Conclusion

Task 2 has been **fully implemented** with all sub-tasks completed:

- ✅ PostgreSQL database connection and configuration
- ✅ Deal model with validation and CRUD operations
- ✅ Store model with location-based queries  
- ✅ User model with preferences and location handling
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for all database operations

The implementation follows best practices for:
- Database design and normalization
- Repository pattern architecture
- Input validation and security
- Error handling and logging
- Test coverage and quality assurance
- Performance optimization

All requirements (2.3, 6.2, 6.3) from the specification have been addressed.
